## 📆 Overview

Hey there, still be driven mad by messy agendas? No handy and simple app found?

This "**Meet Day**" calendar app might be the solution for you. Simple but useful tools supported for you.

1. 📖 Month / Week / Day view page, which could remind you of your daily routine;

## 🛠️  Technology  I use

- React + React Native(Expo)
- TypeScript

💡 I strongly recommend you to use **Expo** for React Native development.

## 🚀 Get Started
